# TNetstrings.info

This is the source for [tnetstrings.info](https://tnetstrings.info/), a
specification for "tagged netstrings".

It's a copy of the spec that was originally at `tnetstrings.org`,
which has since disappeared. The original domain has been squatted on by
some company that apparently specializes in such idiocy, so I opted to
copy the latest version of the original spec I could find (thanks 
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)!) and publish it under a new domain.

As the site says, most of the text was written by Zed A. Shaw; I just fixed some
mismatched tags, and added some CSS and the links to known implementations.
Thanks to him for inventing the protocol in the first place and for this spec.
